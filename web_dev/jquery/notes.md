####Strategies to learn jquery:####

- Time-box. All the research should take 2 hours.
- Find at least 3 resources about jquery online, decide in which order to got through them - 10 min.
- Start from more basic one to more detailed, spend max 25 min reading each one with 5 min breaks in between.
- Find the cheat sheet - 10 min.
- Spend last 10 min researching about the topic that I felt I want to learn more, clarify something or get better understanding.

####Feedback on strategies:####

Time-boxing worked, however I ended up starting practicing the learned stuff about jquery earlier. I felt that I needed to implement the knowledge and see it in action while I was reading about it. So after the first hour, I took a break in researching and created the files for jquery project. And the next hour of my  research I spent trying things out. I think trying things out as you go and read about them helped me a lot to understand them.
