    <h1>Problems and Elephants.</h1>
    <p>You may think:</p>
    <p class="reader_talk"> - What is it up with those two? Problems and elephants, what do they have in common?</p>
    <p class="writer_answer"> - Good question! - I will answer. - Let me show you what they are all about. </p>
  </article>
  <div id="main_story">
    <h2>Imagine...</h2>
    <p>A normal person. A standard one. He goes to work, he comes home, has couple of friends, may be a hobby. His life is "not that exciting", - you may think, but "good enough", - he would argue.</p>
    <p>One day something happens. He got a problem. We won't specify what kind or what's regarding of, but the point is, that something happened and it is now invading the life of this poor person and bringing changes into it. Unwanted changes. And, oh, also the need to make decisions.</p>
    <p id="collaps">The world of this little man is collapsing. Literally.</p>
    <p class="reader_talk">- Why is it collapsing? He got just a small problem, he will solve it, make a decision and move on, right?</p>
    <p class="writer_answer"> - Not this time. Because in the eyes of this little man a huge elephant just entered his world. And this elephant is called "Problem".</p>
    <button id="elephant_enters">Let the elephant in</button>
    <p class="writer_answer">Remember the little nice calm predictable world of the little man? He is now squished. And this little man is thinking...</p>
    <button id="thoughts_of_man">Click on me to see his thoughts</button>
    <p class="writer_answer", id="magic_elephant">But let me tell you this. What the man thinks he sees may not be the real picture. Sometimes our mind plays games and tricks us. Lets take a look at our elephant a little closer. Click two times to make him even bigger so you can see him better!</p>
 </div>
 <div id="conclusion">
  <p>Yes, our elephant was just  a fly! Now you see it for yourself, that a lot of times, we make some huge elephants from our problems. Even when they are in reality just little flies.</p>
  <p>And let's agree fighting flies is easier then fighting elephants. One click and the fly disappear.</p>
  <button id="fly_away">Make the problem fly away!</button>
  <p>As easy as that. Now if only every little man would take a closer look at his elephant... </p>
