# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? Version control is a system that allows you to create different versions of repository and manage them. You can go back to a specific version if needed and reverse the changes. It is useful for working in a team with other developers since it gives you a way to see the changes happening and who is made them. And in case changes are bad, go back to a previous or different version without a necessity of redoing all the work from 0.
* What is a branch and why would you use one? Branch is a version of the repository. By creating new branches and working inside them instead of your main master branch, you are separating your current work and the main code. In case your current work didn't end up with results you wanted you can switch to master branch and still have the original code.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? Commit is a safe point that developer creates in order to make sure he has a saved the changes he made to the code. Good commit message should be clear and straight to the point.
* What is a merge conflict? It is a situation when git can not merge two branches together. If you change the same part of the code in two different branches, you will get a merge conflict.
