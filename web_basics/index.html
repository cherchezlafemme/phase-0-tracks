  Doggy will make you rediscover the world around you. Early morning walks, beautiful sunrises and gorgeous sunsets. You will spend way more time outside! Hear the birds and workout. At least twice a day.</li>

Start your day with a nice walk with your best fuzzy buddy and get ready for an awesome day. And in the evening, right before you will be going to bed, take a nice refreshing walk and spent some time reflecting on your day. You fuzzy friend will be happy to give you a company, trust me.</li>
