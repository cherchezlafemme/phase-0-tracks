What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
They help identify different parts of the code. I think the most useful are main, nav, section, header and footer.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
From the top to bottom.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
Learned how to create snippets. I am confident I will create more snippets since they are such a time-saver. 

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
I can not identify the most difficult concept in this challenge. I felt that our pairing went pretty smooth and I left it with the good understanding of the concepts that we discussed.-->
